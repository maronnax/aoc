# Overview

There are a number of online code projects - Advent of Code
(https://adventofcode.com/), Project Euler
(https://projecteuler.net/), that are lists of small, related
programming problems.

This is a repo for organizing the different projects I do that with -
at least, in the Python language.

# Installation

Run

```
make
make install
```

This will create a virtual environment, install all the packages in
requirements.txt into it, and then install the main project package in
the local environment.

Subsequently, the environment can be activated by running

```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

in the root directory of the repo.
